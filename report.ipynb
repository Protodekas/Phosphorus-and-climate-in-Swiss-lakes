    "# Environmental analysis: weather influence on phosphorus in swiss lakes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This report present the results and interpretation of the analysis of environmental data about phosphorus concentration in lakes in Switzerland, as well as weather data (insolation, rainfall, temperature, fresh snow) in several locations in the country. This work aim to identify tendancies and changes over time. But the main objective is to show if there is any potential correlations between the concentration of phosphorus and climate in swiss lakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "This work is based on two datasets available on [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss):\n",
    "- [Klimadaten: Sonnenscheindauer, Niederschlag, Temperatur und Neuschnee](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/klimadaten-sonnenscheindauer-niederschlag-temperatur-und-neuschnee4) (Climate data: insolation time, precipitation, temperature and fresh snowfall)\n",
    "- [Phosphorgehalt in Seen](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/phosphorgehalt-in-seen5) (Phosphorus content in lakes).\n",
    "The climate dataset consist in four sheets (insolation time in h per year, precipitation in cumulative mm per year, temperature in mean °C per year, and fresh snowfall in cumulative cm per year) of data for 13 locations (Basel-Binningen, Bern- Zollikofen, Davos, Geneva-Cointrin, Locarno-Monti, Lugano, Lucerne, Neuchâtel, Säntis, Sion, St-Gallen and Zurich-Fluntern) from 1931 to 2024. The phosphorus dataset consist in a table of the annual measurements of phosphorus concentration in µg/l in six lakes (lake Lucerne, lake Hallwil, lake Neuchâtel, lake Constance, lake Zug and lake Geneva) from 1951 (first data from 1957) to 2023."

    "## Cleaning and importing the data\n",
    "First, the datasets have been cleaned in LibreOffice Calc. Next to making the files more easily usable with Python, the cleaning was also usefull to get rid of all irrelevant cells and data within the file. This particularly concerns the locations in the climate dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phosphorus dataset covers six lakes, whereas the climate dataset covers 13 locations, most of which being quite remote from the said lakes. So, in order to get the most accurate climate data for the lakes, only the locations closest to the lakes were retained in the climate dataset. For Lake Lucerne, Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Geneva, the locations retained were quite obviously Lucerne, Neuchâtel and Geneva-Cointrin, since they are next to the lakes. For the Lake Constance and Lake Zug, St-Gallen and Lucerne respectively were retained since they are the closest location in proximity and altitude. Concerning Lake Hallwil, both Lucerne and Zurich-Fluntern are the best candidates in terms of proximity and altitude. However, Lucerne was chosen since the city is a bit smaller than Zurich, slighlty reducing the influence of urbanism. In addition, there are several peaks between the lake and Zurich, whereas the space between the lake and Lucerne is a bit flatter, potentially resulting in a bigger climatic difference between the lake and Zurich than between the lake and Lucerne. Zurich-Fluntern was nevertheless kept in the dataset, for comparison purposes.\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "### Exploratory analysis\n",
    "Concerning the trend analysis (see file \"trends_results.json\") of the phosphorus, all trends are globally negative. However, when looking at the plot (fig-01.png), we can see that, for all lakes, the curves start with increasing values until the 70s - early 80s. From then on, the tendency is inverted, with decreasing values, giving the globally negative trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the trend analysis (see file \"trends_results.json\") of the weather data, it is a bit different. The trends are all positive for every locations for insolation time, rainfall and temperature. On the other hand, the fresh snow present negative trends for each locations. For a more detailed description, concerning insolation time (fig-02.png), all locations present a slow decrease in values until a minimum around 1980, before a rapid increase in values. The rainfall (fig-03.png) and fresh snow (fig-05.png) global trends looks generally quite flat, although variable values can vary significantly. Finally, the temperature plot (fig-04.png) show a clear increase in values over time, with what appears to be a positive exponential pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlations\n",
    "The analysis of correlation between the phosphorus concentration and the climate data shows the same results for most locations. For every lakes except Lake Geneva, the climate parameter the most (negatively) correlated to the phosphorus concentration is the temperature (between -0.68 and -0.78), closely followed by the insolation time (between -0.55 and -0.75). The fresh snow is significantly less (positively) correlated (between 0.18 and 0.35), and then the rainfall is (negatively or positively) almost never correlated (between -0.02 and 0.12). As stated before, Lake Geneva is a bit different from the other lakes, since the climate parameter the most correlated to the phosphorus concentration is the insolation time (-0.70), followed by the temperature (-0.58). Another difference with the other lakes is the higher correlation values of the rainfall (0.26).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression models\n",
    "#### Single and multiple linear regression models\n",
    "The first analysis consist in a simple linear regression model (fig-06.png to fig-09.png). For all climate parameters, the observed values for Lake Lucerne, Neuchâtel and Geneva are quite close to the line. However Lake Constance, Hallwil and Zug, the values are much more distant and scattered around the line. This is especially true for the rainfall and fresh snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a multiple linear regression model was tested (fig-10.png to fig-21.png). The model present a R² comprised between 0.59 and 0.70, with Lake Neuchâtel and Constance having a lower value, respectively 0.51 and 0.53. This can be quite clearly observed on the residuals distribution plots of the lakes, where all lakes have a fairly normal distribution, except for Lake Neuchâtel and Constance, that have outliers. Appart for Lake Neuchâtel, for all the other lakes the common significant predicator of the phosphorus concentration is the temperature. Then, for Lake Neuchâtel, as well as three other lakes, the insolation is also considered as a significant predicator. Finally, for Lake Constance and Lucerne, the second significant predicator next to the temperature, is the fresh snow. According to the model, all lakes present multicolinearity in their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the model shows multicolinearity, the correlation between the climate parameters were calculated (fig-22.png to fig-27.png). For all lakes, the strongest correlation is between temperature and insolation time (between 0.64 and 0.71). Then comes the negative correlation between temperature and fresh snow (between -0.43 and -0.56). It is closely followed by the negative correlation between rainfall and insolation time (between -0.33 and -0.53). The fourth highest correlation, is the negative correlation between fresh snow and insolation time (between -0.30 and -0.43). Then rainfall is slighly less positively correlated to fresh snow (between 0.13 and 0.29). Finally, rainfall and temperature are almost not correlated at all (between -0.12 and 0.03).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ridge and Lasso regression models\n",
    "The Ridge and Lasso models present the highest R² values for Lake Zug (0.66 and 0.65), and Lake Hallwil (0.61 and 0.59). The other lakes have significantly lower values: 0.42 and 0.42 for Lake Constance, 0.36 and 0.35 for Lake Lucerne, and 0.22 and 0.22 for Lake Geneva. Finally, Lake Neuchâtel have particularly low R² values for these models: -3.28 and -3.30.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest Regression model\n",
    "The last model to be tested is the Random Forest Regression. Appart for Lake Zug, that present a R² value of 0.63, the other lakes have values quite low compared to the previous models (between 0.18 and 0.36). Once again, just like for the Ridge and Lasso regression models, Lake Neuchâtel have a particularly low R² value (-1.88).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation\n",
    "In regard of the regression model, the one working the best is quite clearly the multiple linear regression model. However, for Lake Zug and Lake Hallwil, the Ridge and Lasso regression models have almost similar R² values. But it is also important to remember that the locations used for the climate data of these lakes are not exactly next to the lakes themselves, but further away. This could also be because Hallwil and Zug are the two lakes with the highest phosphorus concentration in comparison to the other lakes, and with a much more important decrease thab the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple linear model being the best model seems to be consistent with the data. Indeed, according to the model the most significant predictors for the phosphorus concentration in the lakes are the temperature and the insolation. This make sense since the phosphorus concentration show an increase until ca. 1980 before decreasing until the present day (fig-01.png). On the other hand, the insolation time show a decrease until ca. 1980 before increasing (fig-02.png). And the temperature seems to be globally quite constant until ca. 1980 before also showing an increase in the values (fig-04.png). So it appears quite clearly that the phosphorus concentration follow the opposite tendancy of the one displyed by the insolation time and the temperature. This therefore meaning that in regard to the climate, a higher insolation time and higher temperature result in a lower phosphorus concentration in the lakes, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems also that there is a slight correlation between the phosphorus concentration in the lakes and the fresh snow, in the sense that both are decreasing over time (fig-01.png and fig-05.png). But this could be an artifact due to the fact that, since the phosphorus concentration tends to decrease when the temperature increases, that increase in temperature can also obviously lead to a decrease in fresh snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, according to the analysis and the available data, it seems that the phosphorus concentration in the swiss lakes tend to follow the insolation time and the temperature. This relationship is linear and negative. This results in a decrease in the phosphoruse concentration in the lakes when the insolation time and the temperature increase, and vice versa. There could be also a positive relationship between the phosphorus concentration in the lakes and the fresh snow, but it was not clearly proven, and thus it is probably an artifact due to the negative correlation between fresh snow and temperature."
